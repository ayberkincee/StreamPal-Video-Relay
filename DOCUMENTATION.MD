WebSocket Streaming Server Documentation
Overview
This repository contains the code for a WebSocket streaming server built using Node.js and the Express framework. The server facilitates communication between broadcasters and streamers, allowing for the efficient transfer of video data.

Features
WebSocket communication for real-time data transfer.
Support for broadcasters and streamers with unique identifiers.
Handling of chunked video data for efficient streaming.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd <project-folder>
npm install
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will be running on port 3000.

Usage
Broadcasting
Broadcasters can connect to the WebSocket server and send video data in chunks. The server handles the aggregation of these chunks and notifies streamers when the complete video is received.

Streaming
Streamers connect to the WebSocket server and request data from specific broadcasters. They receive the video data in chunks, allowing for efficient streaming.
